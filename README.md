Task Manager Application

This is a task manager application where the user will be able to view their tasks, add more tasks, edit/delete existing tasks, and finally view an error page for any unknown routes.

This application will be built using the Angular framework, and is a practice project I am attempting to learn more about the Angular framework and building an application based off it.
